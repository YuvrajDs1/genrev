    "explanation": "Do you know what an angle is? An angle is formed when two lines or sides meet at a point. There are different types of angles, and today we're going to learn about them. Imagine you have a big pizza that you want to share with your friends. If you cut the pizza into small pieces, each piece will have a pointy corner, and that's an angle! Angles can be big or small. Let's learn about three types of angles: acute, right, and obtuse angles. An acute angle is small, like the corner of a piece of paper. A right angle is like the corner of a book, it's 90 degrees. An obtuse angle is big, like the corner of a big 'L' shape. Now, let's see if you can identify these angles!",
