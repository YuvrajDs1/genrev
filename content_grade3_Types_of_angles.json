  "explanation": "Angles are formed when two lines or rays meet. There are different types of angles. An acute angle is small. It is less than 90 degrees. A right angle is 90 degrees. It looks like the corner of a piece of paper. An obtuse angle is big. It is more than 90 degrees, but less than 180 degrees. A straight angle is 180 degrees. It looks like a straight line. Imagine you are standing with your arms straight out to the sides. Your arms and body make a straight angle. Let's review what we learned: we have acute, right, obtuse, and straight angles. Remembering these types of angles will help you solve problems and understand more about shapes and lines.",
