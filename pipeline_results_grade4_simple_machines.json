    "explanation": "Simple machines are tools that make our work easier. They help us lift, pull, or move things with less effort. There are six types of simple machines: lever, pulley, wheel and axle, inclined plane, wedge, and screw. Let's learn about a few of them. A lever is a bar that pivots around a point, called a fulcrum. It helps us lift heavy things with less effort. For example, when you use a seesaw, you are using a lever. A pulley is a wheel with a rope or chain wrapped around it. It helps us lift heavy things up high with less effort. A wheel and axle is a circular object that turns around a rod, called an axle. It helps us move things with less effort, like when you ride a bike. Simple machines are all around us and make our lives easier.",
